    <h3>Description</h3>
    A delicious tomato soup is a warm and comforting bowl of velvety smooth liquid that's bursting with bright and tangy tomato flavor. It's made from ripe, juicy tomatoes that have been simmered with aromatic herbs like basil and thyme, creating a rich and savory broth. The soup is typically seasoned with salt, black pepper, and a hint of sugar to balance out the acidity of the tomatoes. Some variations of the soup may include a touch of cream or a drizzle of olive oil to add richness and depth of flavor. Whether you're enjoying it as a simple starter or a full meal with a grilled cheese sandwich, a delicious bowl of tomato soup is always satisfying.

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 pounds ripe tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken or vegetable broth</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried basil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the olive oil: In a large pot, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Add 1 chopped onion and 2 minced garlic cloves and saut√© until the onion is translucent and fragrant, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the tomatoes: Stir in 2 pounds of chopped ripe tomatoes, 2 cups of chicken or vegetable broth, 2 teaspoons of dried basil, 1 teaspoon of dried thyme, 1 teaspoon of sugar, and salt and black pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Simmer the soup: Bring the soup to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for about 30 minutes, or until the tomatoes are soft and the flavors have melded together.</li>
        <li>Blend the soup: Use an immersion blender or transfer the soup in batches to a blender to puree it until smooth. If the soup is too thick, you can add more broth or water to thin it out to your desired consistency.</li>
        <li>Reheat and serve: Return the soup to the pot and heat it through over low heat. Taste and adjust the seasonings as needed. Serve hot, garnished with a drizzle of olive oil or a swirl of heavy cream, if desired. Enjoy your delicious tomato soup!</li>
    </ol>
