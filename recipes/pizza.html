    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    Crust:
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    Toppings:
    <ul>

            <li>1/2 cup tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>Optional toppings (fresh basil leaves, cooked sausage, pepperoni, sliced mushrooms, diced onions, etc.)
            </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the crust: In a large bowl, whisk together 1 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon of active dry yeast, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and 1 teaspoon of sugar. Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil and enough warm water (about 1/2 cup) to form a soft dough. Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5 minutes until smooth. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for about an hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven: Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C) and place a pizza stone or baking sheet inside to heat up.</li>
        <li>Roll out the dough: Dust a clean surface with flour and place the dough on top. Use a rolling pin or your hands to shape the dough into a 9-inch circle.</li>
        <li>Add the toppings: Place the dough on a piece of parchment paper or a floured pizza peel. Spread 1/2 cup of tomato sauce evenly over the crust, leaving about 1/2 inch of crust around the edges. Sprinkle 1 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce and add any optional toppings you like.</li>
        <li>Bake the pizza: Carefully slide the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone or baking sheet in the oven. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy: Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Slice and serve hot. Enjoy your delicious homemade pizza!</li>
